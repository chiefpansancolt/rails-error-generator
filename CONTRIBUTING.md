### Issue and Pull Request Labels

[GitHub search](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) makes it easy to use labels for finding groups of issues or pull requests you're interested in. For example, you might be interested in opening an Issue or perhaps opening a pull request. To help you find issues and pull requests, each label is listed with search links for finding open items with that label in Rails Error Generator. We  encourage you to read about [other search filters](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) which will help you write more focused queries.
